I am a Senior Undergraduate majoring in Chemical Engineering at IIT Delhi. My research experiences have been broadly related to computational aspects of Chemical Engineering, having done projects in Deep Learning, Numerical Modeling, MD Simulation and CFD. I am planning to start my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2020.
