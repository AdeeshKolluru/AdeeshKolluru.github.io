I am a second-year PhD student advised by [Prof. Zachary Ulissi](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/bio/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My work focuses on building efficient machine learning algorithms to accelerate computational catalysis. I am currently working on the [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/) in collaboration with [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). 

My undergraduate research experiences have been broadly related to computational aspects of Chemical Engineering, having completed projects in Deep Learning, Numerical Modeling, MD Simulation and CFD applications. I have worked on numerous projects with [Prof. Anurag Rathore](http://biotechcmz.com/work-experience.html) at IIT Delhi in the field of modeling bioprocesses using CFD and Deep Learning. I have also been fortunate to do research internships with [Prof. Faye McNeill](http://mcneill-lab.org/v-faye-mcneill/), Columbia University and [Prof. Duane Loh](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/duaneloh/), National University of Singapore developing Deep Learning models for Air Quality and Protein Motif identification applications respectively.

Apart from research and academics, I had been actively involved in various sports and cultural activies at IIT Delhi. Played Waterpolo for the college team and was part of Debating Club. In my free time, I read non-fiction novels (mind, human behaviour, human body, economics), watch movies/TV shows/documentaries and enjoy swimming, playing chess (send me a challenge on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/adeeshk) or [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/adeeshk)). 

If you have questions about my research or want to collaborate on anything, feel free to reach out to me via email.
