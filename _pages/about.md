I am a first year PhD student advised by [Prof. Zachary Ulissi](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/bio/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My work focuses on building efficient machine learning algorithms to accelerate computational catalysis. I am currently working on the [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/) in collaboration with [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). 

My past research experiences have been broadly related to computational aspects of Chemical Engineering, having completed projects in Deep Learning, Numerical Modeling, MD Simulation and CFD applications. During my undergrad, I have worked on numerous projects with [Prof. Anurag Rathore](http://www.biotechcmz.com/biosketch) at IIT Delhi in the field of modeling bioprocesses using CFD and Deep Learning. I have also been fortunate to do research internships with [Prof. Faye McNeill](http://mcneill-lab.org/v-faye-mcneill/), Columbia University and [Prof. Duane Loh](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/duaneloh/), National University of Singapore developing Deep Learning models for Air Quality and Protein Motif identification applications respectively.

Apart from research and academics I have been actively involved in various sports and cultural activies at IIT Delhi. I had been a part of Waterpolo Team of IIT Delhi and a Representative for Debating Club. I was also elected as the Sports Secretary of Board for Sports Activities, IIT Delhi. Some other interests include reading non-fiction novels (mind, human behaviour, human body, economics), watching sci-fi movies/TV shows and listening to songs.
