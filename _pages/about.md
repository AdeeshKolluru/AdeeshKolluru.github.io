I am a Senior Undergraduate in Chemical Engineering at IIT Delhi. My research experiences have been broadly related to computational aspects of Chemical Engineering, having completed projects related to Deep Learning, Numerical Modeling, MD Simulation and CFD. 

I have worked on numerous projects with [Prof. Anurag Rathore](http://www.biotechcmz.com/biosketch) at IIT Delhi in the field of modeling bioprocesses using CFD and Deep Learning. I have also been fortunate to do research internships with [Prof. Faye McNeill](http://mcneill-lab.org/v-faye-mcneill/), Columbia University and [Prof. Duane Loh](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/duaneloh/), National University of Singapore developing Deep Learning models for Air Quality and Protein Motif identification applications respectively.

My passion for solving complex problems and impacting lives has motivated me to pursue research. I am planning to start my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in the Fall of 2020.

Apart from research and academics I have been actively involved in various sports and cultural activies at IIT Delhi. I had been a part of Waterpolo Team of IIT Delhi and a Representative for Debating Club. I was also elected as the Sports Secretary of Board for Sports Activities, IIT Delhi. Some other interests include reading non-fiction novels (mind, human behaviour, human body, economics), watching sci-fi movies/TV shows and listening to songs.
